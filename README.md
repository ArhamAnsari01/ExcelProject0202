# ExcelProject0202
Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a raw customer demographics dataset and used Microsoft Excel to clean, transform, analyze, and visualize the data. The main goal of this project was to practice real-world Excel data analysis by turning unstructured and inconsistent data into a clear, interactive dashboard that can be used for business decision-making.

This project focuses on core Excel skills that are commonly expected from a data analyst, including data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and dashboard creation.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer demographic information such as gender, marital status, and age. The raw data had duplicate records and inconsistent categorical values, which made analysis difficult before cleaning.

Data Cleaning and Preparation

I performed the following data cleaning steps in Excel:

Removed duplicate records to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

Standardized the Gender column by replacing abbreviated values:

M was replaced with Male

F was replaced with Female

Standardized the Marital Status column to remove confusion:

M was replaced with Married

S was replaced with Single

Created a new Age Bracket column to group individual age values into meaningful age groups. This made the analysis and visualizations easier to read and interpret.


Data Analysis

After cleaning the data, I created multiple pivot tables to analyze customer demographics. These pivot tables were used to explore patterns and distributions across gender, marital status, and age groups. Pivot tables allowed me to summarize the data efficiently and prepare it for visualization.

Dashboard Creation

Using the pivot tables, I built an interactive Excel dashboard. The dashboard includes charts and slicers that allow users to filter and explore the data dynamically. The focus of the dashboard was clarity and usability, making it easy to identify trends and compare different demographic segments.

Through this project, I improved my understanding of how important data cleaning is before analysis. I also gained hands-on experience in using pivot tables and slicers to build interactive dashboards and present insights in a clear and structured way.
